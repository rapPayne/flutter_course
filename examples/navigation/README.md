# Navigation

Shows different navigation techniques.

- Stack navigation
- Tab navigation
- Drawer navigation
- 

And each of these navigate to the others; they're all tied in.

## Subroutes

Shows how to effectively create named sub-routes. These are named routes defined below the MaterialApp.

## Tab navigation

There are two:
1. TabBar/Tab/TabBarView - tabs_demo.dart
1. NavigationBar - navigation_bar_demo.dart

These do the same thing in different ways. They shouldn't both be used together in the same widget.
